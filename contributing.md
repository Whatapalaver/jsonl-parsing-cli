# How to contribute to Ruby CLI Parser

## Hacktoberfest contributors

I think this would be a great project for a junior Ruby developer to contribute to. I have started by creating a JSONL parser that can be controlled from the command line but it might be great to expand this to cover other file formats.

I will create a series of issues that I would like to be completed and that I would intend to merge into master. Please feel free to claim one of these.
